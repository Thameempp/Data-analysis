### Feature engineering is the :
process of selecting, transforming, and creating input variables (features) from raw data so that a machine learning model can understand the data better and make more accurate predictions.


### rule to remember :
Clean → Create → Encode → Transform → Scale → Balance → Select


### Why feature engineering is important :

- ML models do not understand meaning, only numbers
- Better features = better accuracy
- Often more important than the choice of algorithm
- Reduces overfitting and noise
- Improves training speed and stability
